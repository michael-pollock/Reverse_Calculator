Reverse Calculator

Reverse Calculator and normal Calculator mode currently work individually.
A link will be made in the future allowing a user to select which mode to use.

For Reverse Calculator: 
Enter the answer suchas: 65
Enter the operations (limited to */+-) suchas: +-*
An answer is formulated and returned suchas 5+10-5*-10

Note:
Without checking at the moment, I believe the reverse calculator may have flawed logic with permdas.
